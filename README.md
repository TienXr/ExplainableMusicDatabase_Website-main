## Project Structure

All files outside of the 'client' folder are used by the express server.

- 'server.js' is the entry script for the server.
- 'app.js' creates and configures the express app.
- The directory 'routes\api' contains the actual server functions and logic.
- The 'models' directory contains our database schemas.

Everything within the 'client' folder is related to the React client.

- The 'components' directory contains the '.js' component files.
- The 'public\uploads' directory contains '.mid' and '.pdf' files that users uploaded
